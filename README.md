#Java Software Developer Assessment - Airtime VTU API Implementation

#Overview:
This repository contains my solution for the Java Software Developer Assessment. The assessment required me to implement an API for authentication using JWT, consume the airtime VTU API from the provided documentation, write unit tests with at least 50% code coverage, and push the code to GitHub with a readme page documenting what I've done.

#Authentication API using JWT:
For the authentication API, I implemented a secure JWT-based authentication system. Users can register, login, and receive a JSON Web Token (JWT) upon successful authentication. This token is used for subsequent API requests to ensure secure access to protected resources.

#Airtime VTU API Consumption:
I successfully integrated the airtime VTU API based on the provided documentation from the Biller Service Test environment portal. The API allows users to perform airtime VTU (Virtual Top-Up) transactions. I used Java's HttpClient to make HTTP requests to the VTU API endpoints, and I handled responses and errors appropriately.

#Unit Tests with Code Coverage:
I created a comprehensive set of unit tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of the implemented functionalities. I used JUnit and Mockito to write the unit tests. The test coverage was carefully maintained and achieved at least 50% code coverage
